# Language Server for NASM/GAS/GO Assembly

[![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/asm-lsp.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/asm-lsp)
[![Tests](https://github.com/bergercookie/asm-lsp/actions/workflows/lint_and_test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bergercookie/asm-lsp/actions/workflows/lint_and_test.yml)

## Goal

Provide hovering, autocompletion, signature help, go to definition, and view
references for assembly files written in the GAS/NASM or GO assembly flavors. It
supports assembly files for the x86, x86_64, ARM, RISCV, z80, and 6502 instruction
sets.

This tool can serve as reference when reading the assembly output of a program.
This way you can query what each command exactly does and deliberate about
whether the compiler is producing the desired output or whether you have to
tweak your code for optimisation.

## Installation

### Using cargo

Install using the cargo package manager, either from `crates.io` or from github:

```bash
cargo install asm-lsp
# or to get the latest version from github
cargo install --git https://github.com/bergercookie/asm-lsp asm-lsp
```

Install using the cargo from source:

```bash
cargo install --path asm-lsp
```

### Precompiled Binaries

Download and uncompress the appropriate precompiled binaries from the project's
[releases page](https://github.com/bergercookie/asm-lsp/releases).

## Set up as a language server

Add a section like the following in your `settings.json` file:

```json
"asm-lsp": {
    "command": "asm-lsp",
    "filetypes": [
        "asm", "s", "S"
    ]
}
```

### [OPTIONAL] Configure via `.asm-lsp.toml`

Add a `.asm-lsp.toml` file like the following to your project's root directory
and/or `~/.config/asm-lsp/` (project configs will override global configs) to
selectively target specific assemblers and/or instruction sets. By default, diagnostics
are enabled and the server attempts to invoke `gcc` (and then `clang`) to generate
them. If the `compiler` config field is specified, the server will attempt to use
the specified compiler to generate diagnostics. Different configurations can be
created for different sub-directories or files within your project as `project`s.
Source files not contained within any `project` configs will use the default configuration
if provided.

#### Config Builder (MASTER BRANCH ONLY)

Creating a `.asm-lsp.toml` file manually is fine, but can be error-prone as projects
grow in complexity. Running `asm-lsp gen-config` will walk you through the creation
of a config interactively, with informative prompts and extra validation checks
along the way.

```
$ asm-lsp gen-config --help
Generate a .asm-lsp.toml config file

Usage: asm-lsp gen-config [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -o, --output-dir <OUTPUT_DIR>      Directory to place .asm-lsp.toml into. (Default is the current directory)
  -g, --global-cfg                   Place the config in the global config directory
  -p, --project-path <PROJECT_PATH>  Path to the project this config is being generated for. (Default is the current directory)
  -w, --overwrite                    Overwrite any existing .asm-lsp.toml in the target directory
  -q, --quiet                        Don't display the generated config file after generation
  -h, --help                         Print help
```

#### NOTE

If the server reads in an invalid configuration file, it will display an error
message and exit.

```toml
[default_config]
# Configure documentation available for features like hover and completions
assembler = "go"
instruction_set = "x86/x86-64"

[opts]
# The `compiler` field is the name of a compiler/assembler on your path
# (or the absolute path to the file) that is used to build your source files
# This program will be used to generate diagnostics
compiler = "zig" # need "cc" as the first argument in `compile_flags.txt`
diagnostics = true
default_diagnostics = true

# Configure the server's treatment of source files in the `arm-project` sub-directory
[[project]]
path = "arm-project"
assembler = "gas"
instruction_set = "arm"

[project.opts]
compiler = "zig"
compile_flags_txt = [
  "cc",
  "-x",
  "assembler-with-cpp",
  "-g",
  "-Wall",
  "-Wextra",
  "-pedantic",
  "-pedantic-errors",
  "-std=c2y",
  "-target",
  "aarch64-linux-musl",
]
```

Valid options for the `instruction_set` field include:

- `"x86"`
- `"x86-64"`
- `"x86/x86-64"` (Enable both)
- `"arm"`
- `"arm64"`
- `"riscv"`
- `"z80"`
- `"6502"`
- `"avr"`

Valid options for the `assembler` field include:

- `"gas"`
- `"go"`
- `"masm"`
- `"nasm"`
- `"ca65"`
- `"avr"`

Don't see an architecture and/or assembler that you'd like to work with? File an
[issue](https://github.com/bergercookie/asm-lsp/issues/new/choose)! We would be
happy to add new options to the tool.

### [OPTIONAL] Extend functionality via `compile_commands.json`/`compile_flags.txt`

Add a [`compile_commands.json`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html#format)
or [`compile_flags.txt`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html#alternatives)
file to your project's root or root `build` directory to enable inline diagnostic
features, as well as to specify additional include directories for use in hover
features. If a `compile_commands.json` or `compile_flags.txt` file isn't provided,
the server will attempt to provide diagnostics with a default compile command.
This feature can be disabled by setting the `default_diagnostics` config field
to `false`.

### VSCode Support

The project has not published any VSCode extension package yet. However, there is
a development extension in the [`editors/code`](https://github.com/bergercookie/asm-lsp/blob/master/editors/code/README.md)
directory with setup instructions.

## Root directory must contain `.git`

The lsp searches for a `.git` directory to locate the root of your project.
Please be sure to run `git init` if your project is not already configured as a
git repository.

### Signature Help

![](https://github.com/bergercookie/asm-lsp/blob/master/demo/signaturehelp.gif)

- Triggering signature help is dependent on your editor and LSP client.
  - Using Neovim's built in LSP client, this can be done via the command
    `:lua vim.lsp.buf.signature_help()`.
  - Using coc, [this issue comment](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/issues/2656#issuecomment-845903417)
    suggests the remap `inoremap <silent> ,s <C-r>=CocActionAsync('showSignatureHelp')<CR>`
    to trigger signature help in insert mode.

      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
